I am a Postdoctoral Informatics Scientist at the [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/scientists/groups/oxford), University of Oxford working with the knowledge-exchange network [UK SPINE](https://www.kespine.org.uk/about/university-oxford), and a Visiting Scientist at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) with [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/). In my research we aim to identify potential drug targets for age-related morbidities.
